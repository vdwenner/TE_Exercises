Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee
Expected output:
    getTimesheetsByEmployeeId(1) returns a list of 2 timesheets
Actual output:
    getTimesheetsByEmployeeId(1) was returning a list of 1 timesheet
How did you fix this bug?
    Replaced if(results.next()) with while(results.next()) in getTimesheetsByEmployeeId so all results are processed.

Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    getTimesheetsByProjectId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project
Expected output:
    getTimesheetsByProjectId(1) returns a list of 3 timesheets
Actual output:
    getTimesheetsByProjectId(1) was returning a list of 2 timesheets
How did you fix this bug?
    Modified the WHERE clause in the SQL used by getTimesheetsByProjectId to filter on project_id rather than employee_id.

Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    updated_timesheet_has_expected_values_when_retrieved
Expected output:
    getTimesheet(1) returns a timesheet with billable set to false (after updating that value with updateTimesheet)
Actual output:
    getTimesheet(1) was returning a timesheet with billable set to true
How did you fix this bug?
    Added billable to the list of fields being updated by the SQL in updateTimesheet.

Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    getBillableHours_returns_correct_total
Expected output:
    getBillableHours(2, 2) returns 0
Actual output:
    getBillableHours(2, 2) was returning 2.0 (the total of all timesheets, not just the billable ones)
How did you fix this bug?
    Added billable = true to the WHERE clause of the SQL used by getBillableHours.
