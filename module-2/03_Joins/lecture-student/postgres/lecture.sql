-- Write a query to retrieve the name and state abbreviation for the 2 cities named "Columbus" in the database


-- Modify the previous query to retrieve the names of the states (rather than their abbreviations).


-- Write a query to retrieve the names of all the national parks with their state abbreviations.
-- (Some parks will appear more than once in the results, because they cross state boundaries.)


-- The park_state table is an associative table that can be used to connect the park and state tables.
-- Modify the previous query to retrieve the names of the states rather than their abbreviations.


-- Modify the previous query to include the name of the state's capital city.

-- Write a query to retrieve the number of cities in the city table for each state in the Midwest census region.


-- Modify the previous query to sort the results by the number of cities in descending order.



-- LEFT JOIN

-- Write a query to retrieve the state name and the earliest date a park was established in that state (or territory) for every record in the state table that has park records associated with it.
SELECT st.state_name, MIN(pk.date_established) AS First_Park FROM state st INNER JOIN park_state pkst
                                ON st.state_abbreviation = pkst.state_abbreviation
                                        INNER JOIN park pk
                                                ON pk.park_id = pkst.park_id
GROUP BY state_name;

-- Modify the previous query so the results include entries for all the records in the state table, even if they have no park records associated with them.
SELECT city_name AS Placeholder, 'City' AS source FROM city
UNION
SELECT state_name AS Placename, 'State' AS source FROM state
ORDER BY Placename
;

-- UNION

-- Write a query to retrieve all the place names in the city and state tables that begin with "W" sorted alphabetically. (Washington is the name of a city and a state--how many times does it appear in the results?)


-- Modify the previous query to include a column that indicates whether the place is a city or state.
