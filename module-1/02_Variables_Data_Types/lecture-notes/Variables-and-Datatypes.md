# Variables and Data Types - Lecture Notes
###### (05/07/2018)

## **Session Objectives**

Students should be able to:

* identify and explain the fundamental concepts and components of Java / .NET
* read and write code that uses variables
* declare a variable and assign a value to a variable
* know and use industry acceptable naming conventions for variables
* choose the appropriate primitive data type to represent different kinds of data in a program
* utilize arithmetic operators to form mathematical expressions
* explain the concept of data conversion (or casting), when it occurs, why it's used
* explain the purpose and use of literal suffixes and why they should be used
* code and test a simple Java or .NET program using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
* perform simple tasks in an IDE such as:
    * Organizing code into projects
    * Understand feedback on syntax errors
    * Utilize the "IntelliSense" feature of an IDE to assist in code development

## **Overview of Session**

Yesterday, we talked about the tools we can use to create applications. Today, we'll be writing our first program.

All applications that you write consist of two aspects: data and behavior. We'll define **data** that holds information that our program stores and **behavior** that manipulates that data and transforms it into something valuable.

The focus of today's lecture is to look at how the data part of our application is stored and used in a program.

## **Classroom Preparation**
Write the following on the whiteboard:
1. Hello World Program

    Java:
    ``` java
    package com.techelevator;

    public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Prints out Hello World
            System.out.println("Hello World");
        }
    }
    ```
    C#:
    ``` csharp
    using System;
    class HelloWorldClass
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Prints out Hello World
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
        }
    }
    ```

## **Topic List w/Notes** <div class=topicNote>(and <span class='link'>links</span> to e-book section when available)</div>

### Java

The following [link to Variables and Data Type - Java](Variables-and-Data-Types-Java.md) which covers:

* Introduction to Java
* Introduction to IntelliJ
* Java Hello World Program

### .NET

The following [link to Variables and Data Types - .NET](Variables-and-Data-Types-.NET.md) which covers:

* Introduction to .NET Core framework
* Introduction to Visual Studio
* C# Hello World Program

### (Both Java and .NET)
### [Variables](https://book.techelevator.com/v2_4/content/introduction-to-programming-ool.html#variables)

<div class="definition note">A <span>variable</span> is a storage container paired with a symbolic name or identifier. It holds some known or unknown amount
of information referred to as a value. It is used to assign and access the value of data.</div>

<div class="analogy note">A variable is like a box. The name on the outside should tell you what is inside.</div>

![Variable Visual](../../resources/variable-visual.png)

#### [Data Types](https://book.techelevator.com/v2_4/content/introduction-to-programming-ool.html#data-types)

<div class="definition note">A <span>bit</span> can have two values. 0 or 1, off or on.</div>

<div class="definition note">A <span>byte</span> is made up of 8 bits.</div>

<div class="analogy note">

Use an example to tell the students that knowing the data is not enough; they need to know the *type* of the data, too.

Ask the students what number **10** is. Indicate that in the Base 10 system, this is the number 10, but in Base 2, it is the number 2. The actual value of the data depends on the type.

</div>

All data in a computer is represented by bits. When we create a variable, we have to tell the computer how we want it to treat these bits. We do this by defining data types on variables that defines how the bits and bytes inside it are interpreted by the system.

<div class="note instructorDirective">

Go over the data types written on the board in preparation for Step 2 and discuss what the data type primitives would be best used for.

</div>

#### [Declaration Statements](https://book.techelevator.com/v2_4/content/introduction-to-programming-ool.html#declaring-a-variable)

<div class="definition note">A <span>declaration statement</span> introduces a new variable or constant. Variable declarations can optionally assign a value in the declaration. Every variable declaration consists of a type and a name.</div>

You define the value in a variable with a single `=`.

#### [Naming Rules](https://book.techelevator.com/v2_4/content/introduction-to-programming-ool.html#naming-variables)

<div class="definition note"><span>Camel case</span> is a convention that requires that the first character in the name is lower-case and
each subsequent word begins with an upper-case character.</div>

<div class="note instructorDirective">

Show good variable names that describe the data they hold and bad variable names that don't follow the rules.

Mention some rules are conventions and some rules are required. For examples, variable names can't be keywords, and they can't start with a number.

</div>

#### Strings

<div class="definition note">A <span>string</span> represents a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters.</div>

* **Declaring a String**

    With `"..."`

* **Escape Characters**

    Like `\n` and `\t`. Needed because you can't really type a tab or return in a string directly.

<div class="note instructorDirective">

Ask the students to import the lecture code into their IDE. You have to very explicitly walk them through this process today (and for a couple of days following). Make sure everyone gets the code into the IDE and have the lecture code open on their screen before moving forward.

Go over lecture code **1** through **9**. Have the students try it on their own and then do them yourself. Remember to talk about your decisions and dive into any questions they ask.

</div>

### [Arithmetic Operators](https://book.techelevator.com/v2_4/content/introduction-to-programming-ool.html#arithmetic-expressions)

#### [Expressions](https://book.techelevator.com/v2_4/content/introduction-to-programming-ool.html#expressions)

<div class="definition note">An <span>expression</span> is statement of code which can be evaluated to produce a result. We use the result to often
assign the value to another variable or as the input to another expression.</div>

<div class="note instructorDirective">

Go over the arithmetic operators from Preparation Step 3.

</div>

* **Order of Operations**

| Category | Operators |
|----------|-----------|
| multiplicative | `*` or `/` or `%` |
| additive | `+` or `-` |
| assignment | `=` |

* **Assigning a Value from an Expression**
* **Combining Multiple Expressions**

    Show the use of `()` to override the order of operations and emphasize being explicit for readability and maintenance.

<div class="note instructorDirective">

Go through lecture code **10** through **15**. Show how variables can be reused and their value changed by using the variable in an expression that then reassigns back to itself.

</div>

### [Type Conversion](https://book.techelevator.com/v2_4/content/introduction-to-programming-ool.html#type-conversion)

There are two types of casting that occur.

<div class="definition note">Widening / Implicit Casting occurs when we convert from one type with less size to a type with more size.</div>
<div class="analogy note">A good example of this is upgrading from a smaller suitcase to a larger suitcase. We have room for all of our items plus additional space.</div>

<div class="definition note"><span>Narrowing </span> occurs when we convert from a type with more size to a type with less size.</div>
<div class="definition note"><span>Truncation</span> occurs when you go from larger to smaller and have to lose some of the data in the process.</div>
<div class="analogy note">Think about downgrading from a larger suitcase to a smaller suitcase. If it was fully packed, you'd need to truncate or remove some of the data at the end. </div>

<div class="note instructorDirective">

Go through the rest of the lecture code.

Use **16** and **17** to talk about explicit conversion from `int` to `String`.

Use **19** to talk about safe conversion from int to double.

Use **20** to talk about integer math and any time you divide two ints, you will always get an int back. If you want a double, you need to cast one of the ints to a double before doing the operation.

Use **21** to talk about how a double and int will return a double.

Use **22** to show double impreciseness. The answer to 66.6/100 should show a strange answer of 0.66599999999. Talk about how doubles are not precise and shouldn't be used for real world financial applications.

Use **23** to talk about modulo and finding remainders.

Use **24** to talk about overflow of an `int` and that you'll get no warning from it. It's important to know what capacity your data types have and how using a `long` solves the problem. This is a good time to discuss why you wouldn't always just use a `long` to avoid this problem (it's rare and using longs everywhere could cause a memory issue.)

Use **25** to talk about boolean literals.

## Student Exercises (Individual)
<div class='purpose'>(Exercises to be performed by individual students)</div>

These exercises are about making good variable names. Have them import the project into their IDE to complete. Tell the students to focus on making good variable names and choosing the correct data type for the variables. Do a little more hands-on review for this exercise so you can make sure that they rushing through. The point is not to get done - it's to do it correctly.
